# be-smart-and-be-happy
the one who want to study in embedded system+IoT!!
In here, I want to share cpp study with all! In here, I want to share more different idea about
algorithm! I'm studying with BOJ(Baekjoon Online Judge)! Thank you!
Good Luck everyone!

Happy New Year!
the file "co)jisoojeong_text printer.zip" is the release version edited by visual studio 2017
If you want to check cpp code, you can check "basic-text-printer.cpp"
this one is the program that prints string when you wrote on console until you press 'Q'!
you can modify it to another key! Or modify it with switch-case/if-else loop!
Enjoy your coding!

2.update:21-01-2019
I'm trying to study algorithm with BOJ! BOJ2440.cpp is the one of the problems which I solved!
I noted my idea on BOJ2440.cpp! I hope anyone share another idea about it!

3.update:21-01-2019
Share about my thought about BOJ2441 problem!

BOJ11720.cpp
Problem:Sum N numbers that has no blank or EOF
Sol: using atoi and some buffer for storing xth number! and sum all immediately!

BOJ4344.cpp
problem: N Testcase, (the number of students, scores) per testcase
sol: using for loop (3)+ if

12.update:24-01-2019
BOJ4673.cpp
problem: the function named "d(n)" can be defined as " n + (n / 1000) + (n % 1000) / 100 + (n % 100) / 10 + (n % 10)"
because max of "n" is 10000. and we can call the generator as "self number", result by func "not self number"
we must print self number
sol:1.make function d(n)
2.make array that can mark if it is self number or not by using for loop
3.make another for loop for print self number by using index

13.update:24-01-2019
BOJ1065.cpp
problem: there were only one input named "N". N is the natural number less than 1000!!
We can call specific case as "Hansu", which is the number that its digit can be arithmetic sequence
as "123,567"
sol: make function to process for specific pattern
:-1.write N 2. X<=N 3.Check that X is hansu 4. count the number of hansu
:using for loop and if
