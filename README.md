I'm trying to study algorithm with BOJ! BOJ2440.cpp is the one of the problems which I solved!
Problem- * must be printed like

this one is the program that prints string when you wrote on console until you press 'Q'!
you can modify it to another key! Or modify it with switch-case/if-else loop!
Enjoy your coding!
