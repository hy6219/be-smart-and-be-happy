Happy New Year!
the file "co)jisoojeong_text printer.zip" is the release version edited by visual studio 2017
If you want to check cpp code, you can check "basic-text-printer.cpp"

this one is the program that prints string when you wrote on console until you press 'Q'!
you can modify it to another key! Or modify it with switch-case/if-else loop!
Enjoy your coding!
